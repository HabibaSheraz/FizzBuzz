# FizzBuzz in Python

A simple Python implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem.

## Description

The FizzBuzz problem is a common coding exercise that tests basic programming skills. The goal is to loop through the numbers 1 to 100 and:
- Print **"FizzBuzz"** if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Print **"Fizz"** if a number is divisible by 3 (but not by 5).
- Print **"Buzz"** if a number is divisible by 5 (but not by 3).
- Otherwise, print the number itself.

This repository contains a concise and easy-to-understand solution using Python.

## How It Works

The code iterates over a range of numbers from 1 to 100. For each number:
- It checks if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using the modulo operator (`%`).
- If not, it checks if it's divisible by 3.
- Then, it checks if it's divisible by 5.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints the number.
